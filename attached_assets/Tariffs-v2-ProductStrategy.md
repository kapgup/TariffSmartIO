**Product Strategy Document: TariffSmart v2 \- Educational Pivot**

* **Date:** April 12, 2025  
* **Version:** 2.0  
* **Status:** Draft

**1\. Introduction & Vision**  
This document outlines the revised product strategy for **TariffSmart v2**. Recognizing the challenges in maintaining the real-time data features of TariffSmart v1 (as described in the original proposal ), we are pivoting the product direction. The **v2 vision** is to transform TariffSmart from a data-intensive tariff tracking tool into a leading consumer resource for *understanding* international trade and its impacts. We will achieve this through engaging, accessible educational experiences within the mobile app, aiming to become the go-to resource for demystifying trade economics for the average consumer, leveraging a more sustainable, content-driven approach.  
**2\. Problem Statement**  
While TariffSmart v1 aimed to address consumer uncertainty around tariff impacts, maintaining the required real-time data proved unsustainable. However, the core user problem remains: consumers are often confused by tariffs and trade policies. They struggle with basic concepts, terminology, and understanding the potential impact on their lives, making it hard to interpret news or make informed decisions. TariffSmart v2 will address this foundational knowledge gap directly.  
**3\. Target Audience**

* **Primary:** The existing TariffSmart user base and new users fitting the profile of everyday US consumers curious or concerned about economics/trade but lacking formal expertise. They seek clarity and understanding via accessible mobile tools.  
* **Secondary:** Students (High School, College), small business owners seeking basic trade landscape understanding.

**4\. v2 Strategy: Pivot to Education & Foundational Knowledge**  
Our strategy for TariffSmart v2 is to **pivot away from high-maintenance data features** towards **sustainable, high-value educational content**. The initial v2 launch (MVP) will focus on validating this new direction by delivering core learning experiences.

* **Core Focus:** Build foundational trade literacy and user engagement through interactive learning modules and gamified reference tools.  
* **Low Data Maintenance:** This is a core principle of the v2 strategy. Features will rely on curated, relatively static content requiring only infrequent updates, eliminating the need for the complex data pipelines envisioned for v1. The value shifts from live data to the learning experience itself.  
* **Leverage v1 Learnings:** Apply insights gained from v1 usage (e.g., user interest areas, engagement patterns identified via analytics ) to inform v2 content priorities.  
* **Validate Pivot:** The v2 MVP will test the hypothesis that users will engage with and find value in this new educational focus.

**5\. v2 MVP Features**  
The v2 MVP will focus exclusively on the new educational direction, likely replacing most v1 features:

* **Feature 1: Interactive Trade Simulators & Concepts**  
  * **Description:** Engaging modules with mini-simulations, interactive exercises, myth-vs-fact quizzes, and explainers covering core trade concepts.  
  * **Value:** Active learning and testing of understanding, replacing passive data consumption from v1.  
* **Feature 2: Gamified Trade Reference (Dictionary/Explorer)**  
  * **Description:** Easy-to-navigate, gamified reference for key trade terms and simplified summaries of major agreements/principles.  
  * **Value:** Essential background knowledge support, made engaging through gamification.

**6\. v2 MVP Goals & Success Metrics**

* **Goal 1: Establish Foundational Understanding:** Users demonstrate comprehension via v2 features.  
  * *Metric:* Average quiz scores (Feature 1).  
  * *Metric:* Module completion rates (Feature 1).  
  * *Metric:* Usage/lookup rate for reference content (Feature 2).  
* **Goal 2: Drive User Engagement with v2:** Users actively interact with the *new* educational features.  
  * *Metric:* v2 Feature adoption rate.  
  * *Metric:* Session duration/frequency for users interacting with v2 features.  
  * *Metric:* Completion rate of gamified challenges (Feature 2).  
* **Goal 3: Validate Pivot Viability:** Gather positive feedback on the v2 educational focus.  
  * *Metric:* Qualitative feedback specifically on v2 features.  
  * *Metric:* App Store rating trends post v2 launch.

**7\. Monetization Strategy (v2 Approach)**

* **Initial Focus (MVP):** Prioritize user adoption and validation of the educational pivot over revenue. Offer v2 MVP features free.  
* **Future v2 Monetization:** Re-evaluate monetization post-MVP. An education-focused model might involve:  
  * Free tier with basic modules/dictionary.  
  * Premium tier for advanced modules, deeper simulations, ad removal (potentially simpler than the multi-tiered v1 proposal ).  
  * Potentially discard complex B2B/Enterprise tiers from the v1 strategy if focus remains purely consumer education.

**8\. Future Roadmap (Post-v2 MVP)**  
Assuming successful validation of the educational pivot:

* **Phase 2:** Introduce features like the **Product Journey Visualizer** and **Trade Policy Decision Scenarios**.  
* **Phase 3:** Add **Curated Impact Stories & Case Studies**, expand content depth.  
* **Longer Term:** Explore further educational content, potentially specialized tracks, or light community features based on user feedback. Explicitly avoid re-introducing features requiring high-maintenance, real-time data feeds.

**9\. Key Assumptions & Risks (for v2 Pivot)**

* **Assumption:** Users value *understanding* trade concepts, not just seeing tariff data points.  
* **Assumption:** Gamified/interactive mobile learning is an effective format for this topic.  
* **Risk:** Accurately translating complex economic concepts into simple, engaging content requires expertise.  
* **Risk:** Retaining/re-engaging v1 users who expected data-centric features might be challenging. Clear communication about the pivot is needed.
